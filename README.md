## Overview

**Duck On Wheels** is part of the **SEA ME program**, which explores Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) concepts using accessible, open-hardware platforms.

This proof-of-concept project runs on a PiRacer with Raspberry Pi 5, serving as a small-scale experimental SDV.
It aims to build a modular stack for:

This project uses a **PiRacer** powered by **Raspberry Pi 5** to explore:
- Real-time motor and steering control  
- Perception through onboard sensors and camera
- Basic ADAS functions such as lane assist and alerting  
- A transparent and traceable engineering workflow aligned with Trustable Software Framework (TSF) principles

## Objectives

| Layer | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Control** | PWM motor and steering control with PID stabilization |
| **Perception** | Camera-based lane detection and basic sensor fusion |
| **Middleware** | ROS2/MQTT message exchange between modules |
| **UI** | On-device Qt dashboard for visualization |
| **ADAS** | Concept-level lane keeping, alerts, assistive braking |
| **Cloud (Soon)** | Remote telemetry and training feedback |
