## Overview

**Duck On Wheels** is part of the **SEA ME initiative**, an educational and experimental environment focused on **Software Defined Vehicles (SDV)** and **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)**.

This project uses a **PiRacer** powered by **Raspberry Pi 5** to explore:
- Modular SDV software architecture  
- Real-time control and perception  
- Prototype-level ADAS features  
- Reliable and traceable development workflows (TSF-aligned)

## Objectives

| Layer | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Control** | PWM motor and steering control with PID stabilization |
| **Perception** | Camera-based lane detection and basic sensor fusion |
| **Middleware** | ROS2/MQTT message exchange between modules |
| **UI** | On-device Qt dashboard for visualization |
| **ADAS** | Concept-level lane keeping, alerts, assistive braking |
| **Cloud (Soon)** | Remote telemetry and training feedback |
